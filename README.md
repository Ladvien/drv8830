# DRV8830
NodeJS software for the I2c motor driver DRV8830.  Rebuilt from Sparkfun firmware. Greater for Raspberry Pi robots.

Credit for 90% of this code goes to:

[Sparkfun's Mike Hord, aka Mhord'](https://github.com/sparkfun/MiniMoto/blob/master/Libraries/Arduino/src/SparkFunMiniMoto.cpp)

Thanks Mike!

Sadly, Sparkfun has EOL'ed their DRV8830 modules.  _Waaahaaah_.  

However, you can still get them on eBay--and I guess guilt free, since the company who built them is no longer carrying them?  Eh.

I've rewritten it in JavaScript with a few twists.
